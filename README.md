templates for use in github projects

This is a collection of templates that I can use in all sorts of projects. 

Usually when I have to do something more then once.

For templates/  create a "hidden" folder called `.github` 
You can fill it with: ISSUE_TEMPLATE for issues. 

In the new folder, add contribution guidelines. These could include:

    Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
    Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
    Community and behavioral expectations.

# topical guide

each guide must go into a lot of detail. 
"The main goal for topical coverage should be comprehensiveness. 
The reader ought to come away from a close read feeling very comfortable with the topic in question. 
They should feel that they know the vast majority of the possible options, 
and more importantly they should understand how all the concepts fit together. "

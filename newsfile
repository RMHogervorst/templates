News

    It is mandatory to use a NEWS or NEWS.md file in the root of your package. See the sample NEWS file above

    Update the news file before every CRAN release, with a section with the package name, version and date of release, like:

    foobar 0.2.0 (2016-04-01)
    =========================

    Under that header, put in sections as needed, including: NEW FEATURES, MINOR IMPROVEMENTS, BUG FIXES, DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT. Under each header list items as needed. For each item give a description of the new feature, improvement, bug fix, or deprecated function/feature. Link to any related GitHub issue like (#12). The (#12) will resolve on GitHub in Releases to a link to that issue in the repo.
    After you have added a git tag and pushed up to GitHub, add the news items for that tagged version to a Release on the Releases tab in your GitHub repo with a title like pkgname v0.1.0
    If you use NEWS, add it to .Rbuildignore, but not if you use NEWS.md
